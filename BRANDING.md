## 3. Visual Identity

### Color Palette
- **Void Black** (`#050505`): The canvas. Deep, infinite, premium.
- **Starlight White** (`#FAFAFA`): The content. Pure, legible, crisp.
- **Nebula Blue** (`#3B82F6` -> `#60A5FA`): The accent. Subtle gradients representing AI intelligence.
- **Glass**: Heavy use of backdrop blur and semi-transparent whites/blacks to create depth.

### Typography
- **Primary**: **Inter** (Current) or **Geist Sans** (Recommended for more tech feel).
- **Headings**: Light weights (300/400) for large text, creating an airy, elegant feel.
- **Body**: Regular weights (400/500) for readability.

### Design Principles
1.  **Invisible Interface**: The UI should recede. Content is king.
2.  **Kinetic Motion**: Everything should move with purpose. Smooth, physics-based transitions.
3.  **Emotional Intelligence**: The AI shouldn't just be a bot; it should feel like a partner. Use warm language.
4.  **Premium Minimalism**: Ample whitespace. No clutter. Every pixel must earn its place.

## 4. UI/UX Direction
- **Dashboard**: A "Control Center" vibe. Dark mode by default.
- **Cards**: Glassmorphism effects with subtle borders.
- **Interactions**: Hover states should glow or lift.

## 5. Tone of Voice
- **Confident**: We know the way.
- **Concise**: We don't waste time.
- **Human**: We speak your language, not just jargon.
